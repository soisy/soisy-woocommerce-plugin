# Soisy Pay in instalments Official Plugin for WooCommerce

 Official Documentation for Soisy's partners with requirements and installation info can be found here: [ITA](https://doc.soisy.it/it/Plugins/WooCommerce.html) â€” [ENG](https://doc.soisy.it/en/Plugins/WooCommerce.html)


## Local Development Environment

The local development environment uses Docker.  
It's based on [thiagobarradas/woocommerce](https://hub.docker.com/r/thiagobarradas/woocommerce) image.  
It runs on port `80` (sorry for that).    

Wordpress admin page: [http://localhost/wp-admin](http://localhost/wp-admin)  
Wordpress user: `admin`  
Wordpress password: `Mudar123`

Just wait a couple of minutes so that the services goes up.

Once inside you have to activate Soisy Plugin manually. The code mounted is the one you find under the `src/` folder of this repo.
